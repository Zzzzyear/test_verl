# [Abandoned] EGPO Core Independent Implementation

This folder contains the **early attempt to implement EGPO's core algorithm independently of the verl framework**, which is initially designed to decouple EGPO core from verl for modularity

## Status
❌ Abandoned (Failed to run)  
✅ Replaced by: Direct modification of the `verl` framework

## Warning
⚠️ DO NOT use, modify, or reference files in this folder.  
All active EGPO core logic is now maintained within the `verl` framework.
